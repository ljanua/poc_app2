# API to Mockup Mapping

## Scope
This mapping aligns SystemAdmin user lifecycle actions in the mockup with the phase-1 OpenAPI contract direction from the latest plans.

Source plans:
- docs/plans/2026-07-03-001-feat-openapi-postgresql-architecture-plan.md
- docs/plans/2026-07-03-002-feat-system-admin-user-management-plan.md
- docs/plans/2026-07-03-007-feat-persist-mock-data-plan.md

## Screen mapping

| Screen | UI action | OpenAPI operation | Method and path | Success response | Error responses |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| S7-admin-user-management.html | Create User modal submit | Create user | POST /v1/users | 201 Created with sanitized user object | 400 validation_error, 403 forbidden, 409 conflict |
| S7-admin-user-management.html | Change Role modal submit | Change user role | PATCH /v1/users/{userId}/role | 200 OK with updated role | 400 validation_error, 403 forbidden, 404 not_found |
| S7-admin-user-management.html | Change Password modal submit | Change user password | PATCH /v1/users/{userId}/password | 204 No Content | 400 validation_error, 403 forbidden, 404 not_found |
| S7-admin-user-management.html | Deactivate action | Deactivate user | PATCH /v1/users/{userId}/status | 200 OK with inactive status | 403 forbidden, 404 not_found |
| S7-admin-user-management.html | Reactivate action | Reactivate user | PATCH /v1/users/{userId}/status | 200 OK with active status | 403 forbidden, 404 not_found |
| S7-admin-user-management.html | Filter by role/status/search | List users | GET /v1/users | 200 OK with paged list | 403 forbidden |
| S3-team-management.html | Create Team (Coach actor) | Create team (coach auto-assigned) | POST /v1/teams | 201 Created with lead coach set to actor | 400 validation_error, 403 forbidden, 409 conflict |
| S3-team-management.html | Create Team (SystemAdmin actor) | Create team (selected active coach) | POST /v1/teams | 201 Created with selected coach as lead coach | 400 validation_error, 403 forbidden, 409 conflict |
| S3-team-management.html | Change Coach (SystemAdmin only) | Reassign team coach | PATCH /v1/teams/{teamId}/coach | 200 OK with updated team coach | 400 validation_error, 403 forbidden, 404 not_found |
| S1-player-list.html | Team-scoped player list | List players | GET /v1/players?teamName=&query= | 200 OK with filtered players | 400 validation_error |
| S1-player-list.html | Add player with explicit create confirm | Create player or assign existing | POST /v1/players | 201 created for confirmed no-match, 200 for strict move assign | 400 validation_error, 409 conflict |
| S1-player-list.html | Preview create-on-no-match | Preview create | POST /v1/players/preview-create | 200 OK with normalized name preview and duplicate marker | 400 validation_error |
| S1-player-list.html | Duplicate quick action | Assign existing player | POST /v1/players/{playerId}/assign | 200 OK with move/no-op state | 400 validation_error, 404 not_found |

Player persistence mode notes:
- S1 runs backend mode by default (`window.__USE_BACKEND__ = true`) so create/assign operations target `/api/v1/players*`.
- Local-only persistence is allowed for offline regression runs only when `window.__USE_MOCK_LOCAL__ = true` is explicitly set.

## Authorization rules
- SystemAdmin role is required for all S7 user-management operations.
- Coach role receives forbidden responses for all write operations in this screen.
- Mockup coach-view toggle represents a forbidden-path simulation and should map to 403 in API integration tests.
- Coach role cannot execute team coach reassignment actions in Team Management.
- SystemAdmin team create/reassign operations must only accept active Coach users as lead coach targets.
- Team create and team-reassign actor identity is derived from authenticated session context first (session user is source-of-truth).
- Direct navigation without a valid authenticated session must be treated as unauthenticated and return 403 for protected writes.

## Session entry behavior
- S0 login provides authenticated entry for both Coach and SystemAdmin paths.
- Quick admin entry in mockup must perform real login semantics (session established) before redirecting to admin screen.

## Validation expectations
- Create user: name, email, role, and initial password required.
- Change role: role must be one of SystemAdmin or Coach.
- Change password: minimum 10 characters, at least one numeric character, and confirm-match enforced in UI and API.
- Add player: team required (not all), normalized name 2-60 chars, allowed characters are letters, spaces, apostrophe, and hyphen.
- Create-on-no-match: explicit confirmation required before persistence.

## Telemetry events
- user_create_success
- user_create_failed
- user_role_change_success
- user_role_change_failed
- user_password_change_success
- user_password_change_failed
- user_admin_forbidden_attempt
